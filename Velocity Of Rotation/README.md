# Velocity of Rotation

the _.csv_ and _.mat_ files contain the same data, extracted from Figure 19(b) in **Zhao et al. 2004**.

The _.m_ file contains the code to import these into MATLAB and fit a least-squares fit to the log10 of the dataset.

This gives a fit of _**y = 0.0007982x<sup>2</sup> -0.1637x +10.68**_ and also shows the the linear fit expected from the combination of thermodynamic relationships to not fit the data.
