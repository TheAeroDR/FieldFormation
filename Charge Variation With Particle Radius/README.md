# Charge Variation With Particle Diameter

The *lack_model_output_1ed_XXX.txt* contain the simulation results for running the charging model of **O'Hara et al. 2025** for 100, 250 and 500 particles on the particle distribution from **Raack et al, 2018** and a surface electron density of 1 per micron<sup>2</sup>.

The _.cpp_ file contains the code ran to generate the data set. This code is slightly updated from the version in **O'Hara and Reid 2025** to include automatic box length calculation (implemented in the python variant in **O'Hara and Reid, 2025** but not the C++) and updated elements of the physical properties of the particles.

The _.m_ file contains the code to read the files generated by the C++ model, and generate the plot (Figure 4) and the fit Q = 12.53r<sup>2</sup> − 3.73 × 104r<sup>−0.8</sup> (Equation 8)
