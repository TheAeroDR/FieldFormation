# Particle Diameter Variation With Height

the _.csv_ and _.mat_ files contain the same data, entered from Table1 DD #1 in **Raack et al. 2018**. The _.mat_ file additionally contains some extra variables extracted further from this table for ease of use.

The _.m_ file contains the code to import these into MATLAB replicate Figure 6D and 8 from the Raack paper (not used in this work), plot the heat map, and variation of particle diameter profile, evaluate lognormal fits, and make the combine pdf, then compare the the pdf sample to the Raack data.

The heatmap and Raack comparison are used in this work.
