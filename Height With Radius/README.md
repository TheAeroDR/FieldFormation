# Height with Radius Fit

the _.csv_ and _.mat_ files contain the same data, entered from Table1 in **Stanzel et al. 2008**.

The _.m_ file contains the code to import these into MATLAB and fit a least-squares fit to the log10 of the dataset.

This gives a fit of _**y = 0.5 x + 0.6241**_ with 10<sup>0.6241</sup> = 4.21.
