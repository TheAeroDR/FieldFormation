# Field Generation Code and Data

This repository contains the code and data associated with the fits in the paper **Modelling the Formation of Electric and Magnetic Fields in Dust Devils**.

In subdirectories are data and fitting codes for several of the subsections in the methodology: *Height Variation With Radius* (Section 2.2.3), *Particle Diameter Variation With Height* (Section 2.2.4), *Charge Variation With Particle Radius* (Section 2.2.5), and *Velocity Of Rotation* (Section 2.2.6).

The main directory contains the file *fields.py*, which combines the parameterisation outline in the method sections of the paper.

The results of various runs of this code are in the *Data* subdirectory.
